# Calendar Design

## Basic Rules:
Create below UI & Logic using HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery (Do not use any otherframework like react, Vue etc.).
Do not use any UI framework like Bootstrap or others.
Do not use any native or 3rd party calendar/calendarlibrary for calendar UI.
UI should be responsive and keep center of the screen.

You can use internet for any reference.

## Functionality Explanation:
1. Userselect Month and Yearfrom dropdown.
2. If user put any date in `Enter Any Date` input box and press `Enter`, change inputted dated cell
background color. (If cell background color is White, changed to Green. If cell background color is Green, changed to white )

### Example for 2th point:
* Input 9 -> Cell background color converted to Green
* Input 5 -> Cell background color converted to Green
* Input 9 -> Cell background color converted to White
* Input 9 -> Cell background color converted to Green

Means cell background color should change like toggle way (White to Green, Green to White).
